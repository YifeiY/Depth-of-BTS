# Depth-of-BTS
A python program that investigate the depth of randomly generated Binary Search Tree and its depth


BTS Depth.py
  Calculate the depth of a BTS
 
BTS Futher Tests.py
  Investigate the relashionship between a randomly generated BTSs with n elements and the average height/depth of those BTSs using only python standard library and utilizing the power of mordern multi-thread computing.
 
 The conclusion is h ~= 3.786 ln(n) + c where h is the height of the tree, n is number of elements in that tree, c is a small (close to zero) constant that changes depending on the size of experiment done with this program. MSE = 0.040
